# StopWatch-Timer
Allows the user to choose either a stopwatch or timer. When selecting timer, the user can enter the number of hours and minutes before clicking start. The user can also either stop or reset the clock for either option. Also, as the timer is counting, there is an animation that loops around the screen that finishes after each minute.
